# nat workshop

This is an Rstudio project containing rmarkdown notebooks to support the
Virtual Fly Brain "Hacking the connectome" workshop in collaboration with
the Drosophila Connectomics Group based at the Dept of Zoology, 
University of Cambridge.

This repository will focus on the use of the [natverse](http://natverse.org/) 
toolchain for R and parallels a [similar repo](https://github.com/VirtualFlyBrain/training) 
containing exercises for Python.
